# SwiftCollectionsAsAPackage ðŸ“¦

This package wraps up the demo code and slides for my NSLondon 2022.1 talk "Exploring Swift Collections": Join me at NSLondon 2022.1 at Deloitte Digital https://meetu.ps/e/L7yjm/hjkT4/i.

I go through the main features of the package as well as some example applications for everyday iOS development. I really enjoy talking at Meetups and will be looking to continue talking at more events in the future! ðŸ˜€

The recording of my talk is available on YouTube here: https://youtu.be/ao7pIFbIX6w.
